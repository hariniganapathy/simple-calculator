# Simple Python Calculator

A simple, interactive calculator implemented in Python that supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- **Addition**: Adds two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts one number from another.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division**: Divides the first number by the second, with error handling for division by zero.
- **User Input Validation**: Ensures that the user enters valid numbers and selects a valid operation.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the folder containing the script.
4. Run the script with the following command:

   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

5. The program will prompt you to select an operation. Enter the number corresponding to the operation you wish to perform (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, etc.).
6. After selecting the operation, enter two numbers when prompted. The result will be displayed.

## Example

```
Welcome to the Simple Calculator!
Select operation:
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)

Enter choice (1/2/3/4): 1
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 3
The result is: 8.0
```

## Error Handling

- If the user enters a non-numeric value, the program will notify the user and stop.
- The program will also handle division by zero and display an error message if attempted.
